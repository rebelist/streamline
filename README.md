# Streamline

### Engineering and Management Metrics Platform for JSMD

The "Streamline" project is about building a metrics platform that brings together data from Jira, GitLab, Datadog, and
other tools
used across Jochen Schweizer mydays (JSMD). The goal is to give teams and managers clear, data-driven insights into how
work gets done, how fast code moves, how teams collaborate, how stable systems are, and how changes in process actually
affect outcomes.

It’s not just about engineering metrics like delivery speed or reliability, it’s also about giving managers visibility
into team health, workload patterns, and the results of decisions over time. Instead of relying on gut feeling or
scattered reports, the platform helps everyone, developers, leads, and managers, make better calls based on real data.
In the end, it’s a tool to support smarter decisions, continuous improvement, and a more transparent way of working.
