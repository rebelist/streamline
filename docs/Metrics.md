# Overview

In modern software organizations, measuring both **engineering team performance** and **management effectiveness**
is crucial for building high-performing, healthy, and impactful teams. While engineering metrics provide insights into
technical execution and delivery efficiency, management metrics ensure that leadership promotes an environment of
innovation, transparency, growth and collaboration.
In some companies the only metrics used to evaluate engineering teams are sprint velocity and whether teams meet their
sprint goals. While these may provide a surface level view of output, they fail to capture the full picture of
engineering health, effectiveness, and long term impact.
Imagine you’re a doctor in a hospital. To measure the quality of care, you decide to count the number of bandages used.
While it’s easy to track and gives you some data, it doesn’t really tell you much about patient health, recovery rates,
or the effectiveness of treatments.
The same happens when companies over focus on sprint velocity. A team might complete all their story points, but at what
cost? Are they shipping quality code? Is the system stable? Are engineers burning out? Is the work actually moving the
business forward? Without deeper metrics, we are flying blind.
This application aims to provide a richer, more meaningful set of engineering and management metrics, helping teams and
leaders move beyond simplistic measurements and focus on real performance, sustainability, and impact.
**Streamline** aims to track and analyze these key metrics, helping organizations make data driven decisions to improve
team dynamics, optimize workflows, and drive meaningful impact.

### **Why Measure Engineering and Management Metrics?**

Most tools focus only on delivery speed, neglecting the human and strategic factors that influence long-term success.
This application bridges the gap by combining engineering and management metrics, offering a holistic view of how teams
operate, collaborate, and evolve. By making these insights accessible, we enable teams to move beyond gut feelings and
take action based on real data, supporting continuous improvement at all levels of engineering and product.

# Engineering Team Metrics

There are five metric buckets to measure different aspects of engineering teams. These categories cover various
perspectives to analyze how efficiently teams operate, how impactful their work is, and how sustainable their processes
are. Each bucket provides insights into different dimensions of engineering performance, helping teams identify
strengths and areas for improvement.

## **Operational Efficiency**

Measures system performance and cost efficiency (e.g., CPU/memory usage, costs, uptime, error rates).
